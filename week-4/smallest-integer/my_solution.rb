# Smallest Integer

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# smallest_integer is a method that takes an array of integers as its input
# and returns the smallest integer in the array
#
# +list_of_nums+ is an array of integers
# smallest_integer(list_of_nums) should return the smallest integer in +list_of_nums+
#
# If +list_of_nums+ is empty the method should return nil

# Your Solution Below

def smallest_integer(list_of_nums)
=begin
  min_num = list_of_nums[0]
  list_of_nums.each {|x|
    if x < min_num
      min_num = x
    end
  }

  min_num
=end
#refactored solution
   return list_of_nums.min
end
