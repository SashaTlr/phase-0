    // for every name, access office positions for the name being voted for, check if name being voted for exists     as property for the office position
        // add 1 to name
        // else add name as property and give it a value of 1


/*
FOR each position in voteCount, find the name with the highest
votes and assign the highest name to the officers object

  FOR each name in each position of voteCount
    IF maxVotes is less than voteCount[position][name]
    then maxVotes will equal the new vote total
    maxName will equal name

// __________________________________________
// Reflection

//What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
//
//Reinforced the value of bracket notation vs dot notation for
//iterating through objects in JavaScript.
//
//Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
//No, we didn't. I think there would be a more efficient way to
//access the second "level" of the nested objects and flatten that
//level of information, but I haven't been successful in finding a
//good way to refactor our for loops.
//
//What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
//We built a very simple iterative solution, but I am better
//understanding how recursion is going to work to replace these
//kinds of loops structures.
