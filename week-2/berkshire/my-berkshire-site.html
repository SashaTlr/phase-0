1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was challenging to create something from scratch as I forgot some syntax and hadn't practiced using semantic HMTL5. I found the more challening aspect being how to pair on the challenge, as the GPS pairing had very explicit instructions on who does what, and what the steps were. It took some time to fall into a rhythm that made sense, and I think I had a tendency to not navigate as much as I could have when my partner was driving. There was a lag in our connection as well, so I couldn't tell if my partner was waiting for me for additional information. I think I may have jumped ahead a bit when I was driving, but I did make an effort to verbalize each step explicitly before I added code.

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  This was a little confusing. We had read that using elements such as <section>, <header>, and <footer> were preferred to using divs, so we avoided using divs and tables. The validation tool was confusing as well, and would show issues with our <section> closing elements. The website seemed to be working fine so we didn't understand the errors.

3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I think we did a good job at keeping to best practices. We did practice centering the header using the <center> tag. We used the H1, H2, etc tags to organize our outline, but didn't use anything for formatting such as bolding.

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML seems messy to organize. A webpage is a 2D image, but has to be translated into linear code. For example, to create a table, you're not creating a for loop or an array. You have to create a separate row element for every cell in the table. That can turn into very messy code as soon as you move to something even slightly complex.
  What is good about HTML is how explicit it is and how easy it is to compile. I like that you can see the source code of different websites and explore how they have set up their pages.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I use the skillcrush cheat sheet and my own notes that I've made. In addition, sublime automatically adds in a closing tag and has suggestions, which helps speed up writing HTML and remembering syntax.
